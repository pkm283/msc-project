    <h1>Lesson 2: History of Kotlin</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine taking the best of many different languages—C++, C#, Erlang,
      Groovy, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk—throwing them
      into a blender and turning it on; the resulting cocktail is Kotlin. The
      strength of Kotlin is in its diversity. Andrey Breslav and the team of developers behind the language at
      JetBrains2 set out to create a fluent, expressive, pragmatic, and easy to
      use language that is less verbose than many mainstream languages. As programmers pick up Kotlin, they quickly recognize good parts of their
    familiar languages and, at the same time, are intrigued by other awesome
    capabilities they’ve not been exposed to before. The familiar ideas in Kotlin makes programmers feel at home as they learn
      and adopt the language, yet the ideas that are new to them make them more
      productive compared to the languages they’re used to. That’s part of the
      reason why programmers are passionate about Kotlin. The biggest uptick in interest for Kotlin came right after Google’s
      announce- 3 ment that Kotlin is an official language for Android
      development. An endorsement from Google is certainly significant, but
      there are more reasons to be excited about Kotlin.
